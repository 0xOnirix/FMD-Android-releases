# FMD-Android-releases
This is just a repo automatically building an APK from every new release of FMD Android app release with a Github Action.

I made it because i wanted to use [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/) instead of F-droid.

The code come from [FMD Android](https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-android) project.
